# Dog Park Locator

Live demo [here](https://geraldbcastillo.github.io/and-chill)

In case it isn't painfully opvious from my [portfolio](https://geraldbcastillo.com), most of my life revolves around my dog.
Because of this, I thought a fun project to do would be to build a dog park locator.


## Technologies used
* React
* [Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api)
* [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)
* Sass
* Bootstrap

## To-do
### Logistical
- [ ] Organize JS and styles
- [ ] Update rendering for results
- [ ] Start NodeJS to stop exposing my API credentials!

### User experience
- [ ] Add map for visuals
- [ ] Create dynamic links to open tab that will start directions to dog park based on user location using additional Google Maps API(s)
